  # Does there need to be dataset object for `things/UMaine/A01/met`?

processing:
- slug: umaine

    platform: A01

# University of Maine needs to do a lot of aggregation from
# various transmission sources, before data can be appropriately
# aggregated to continue through processing. Because of this
# the exact further processing steps are unknown,
# but here is an example of two

# - topic: nmea # converts NMEA formatted CSV data into JSON
#   meta:
#     platform: A01
# - topic: ioos_qc # runs IOOS QC with a config defined in the meta
#   meta:
#     fields:
#       air_temperature:
#         spike_test: true

# The destination is an optional field, for when the desired end topic
# of the source data is known before processing is started
